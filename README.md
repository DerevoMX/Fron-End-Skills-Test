## Full Instructions

    If you're here it means you want to apply for our Front-End Developer position. 

    1. Clone the repository (Don't fork the code as others may use your code to get
       some time advantage).

    2. Build a web page like Mockups (desktop / mobile) using web technologies. The closer you get to replicate the exact appearance the better.

    3. User the images on the assets folder to build the web site (remember you have a few hours to complete).

    4. Responsiveness is a must! so take your time to create styles for mobile devices as well.

    5. The table at the bottom must be filled in with data from the swapi API. Specifically, the People route https://swapi.co/api/people/

    6. You can use any library to get the job done! (Angular, Vue, React or any other are welcome).

    7. Zip your code and send it to <karla.pacheco@derevo.com.mx>

    8. You have 5 hours to complete the code (don't worry if you don't finish, submit your progress anyway).
    
    9. Good Luck and Happy coding!
